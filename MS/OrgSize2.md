## Abstract

Species composition of local communities often varies in response to
differences in the environment. Local organisms are "filtered" from the
regional species pool when their sensitivity to local environmental conditions
prevents their establishment or persistence. However, not all groups of
organisms are equally sensitive to the same environmental variation.
Observational studies have already suggested that larger-bodied species are
more strongly filtered by habitat than smaller- bodied species. However, this
mechanism has never been tested experimentally. In our study we placed highly
similar aquatic communities (composed of insects, zooplankton and bacteria)
into different environments and observed subsequent divergence in composition.
We predicted that insects would show a strong change in composition,
zooplankton a weaker one and bacteria little to no change. Our results are
consistent with these predictions, with the exception of a weaker signal in
insects than expected. These results suggest that organism size could provide
a framework for integrating studies of environmental filtering across
different scales and systems.

## Introduction

Community composition of local patches varies in response to the environment;
however not all groups of organisms show the same amount of environmental
signal. Similar communities are present in similar environments; this "habitat
filtering" occurs when qualities of the habitat (abiotic or biotic) prevent
species from colonizing or persisting in a habitat. In contrast, neutral
models of biodiversity consider all individuals in a community to be
demographically equivalent; differences in species composition are therefore
the result of dispersal and demographic stochasticity. This has led to the
approach of partitioning variance in community composition into variation
correlated with space, with environmental distance, or with their interaction.
These studies have returned mixed results for different groups of organisms
and systems (Cottenie). In one of the first studies across different groups of
organisms within the same community along the same gradient, Farjalla et al
(2012) demonstrated that the size of a group of organisms is a key trait that
determines environmental signal. Specifically, they found that larger bodied
organisms show a greater degree of habitat filtering: there is greater
environmental structure as body size increases from bacteria (weak),
zooplankton (intermediate) and insects (strong).

When will the strength of environmental filtering decrease with organism size?
There are two possible mechanisms that may make communities of smaller
organisms less strongly filtered: increased dispersal rates and increased
plasticity. Dispersal rates increase when smaller organisms are easily
passively carried (e.g. by wind). Increased dispersal brings new immigrants
into a patch, many of whom may not be able to persist without the constant
supply of new immigrants. This "source-sink" dynamic (Leibold) can lead to
similarity between patches even when their environments favour different
community compositions. Increased plasticity, on the other hand, occurs when
smaller-bodies species have broader fundamental niches than larger-bodied
species in the same community. This is the "size-plasticity" hypothesis of
Farjalla et al (2012). They point out that bacteria and other small organisms
are broadly generalist in their ability to consume carbon sources and persist
in different climates (Finlay 2002) and are less constrained by the complex
physiological pathways that larger metazoans possess. Additionally, smaller
bodied organisms have shorter generation times and generally larger
populations, which may allow them the opportunity to evolve to a novel
environment, while the population of larger-bodied organisms cannot persist.

The size-plasticity hypothesis makes a testable prediction about the
consequences of environmental variation for similar communities: community
composition will become different in different environments, but this change
will be greatest between larger species and increasingly weak in smaller
organisms. To test these predictions, we performed a manipulative experiment
in the same habitat as the original Farjalla et al. (2012) study. We used the
same environmental gradient and studied the same groups of organisms:
specifically, the patchy, contained habitats found in tank bromeliads. We
created communities that were as similar as possible in composition of
insects, zooplankton and bacteria, then exposed these communities to their
original environmental gradient. We predicted community change to be greater
and more consistent in insects, less strong in zooplankton and absent in
bacteria; if instead differences in communities are driven by space alone we
will see no difference in the strength of environmental signal across all
groups.

## Methods

We performed two complementary experiments to test how different groups within
these communities respond to environmental variation: in the first, we
contrasted communities from different bromeliad species and habitats, while in
the second we contrasted communities from a single generalist bromeliad. For our
between-species experiment we used _Aechmea nudicaulis_ (full sun habitats),
_Vriesea neoglutinosa_ (partial shade), and _Neoregelia cruenta_ (deep shade).
Our between-habitat experiment used _Neoregelia cruenta_ only, sampled from
exposed and shaded habitats.  _N. cruenta_ is both common and highly plastic;
its distribution overlaps with that of all other bromeliads at this site. This
allows us to separate the effects of bromeliad species identity from habitat in
our two analyses.

We performed these experiments at the Parque Nacional de Jurubatiba, in Rio de
Janeiro state, Brazil; our community patches are the tank bromeliads which are
common there. These bromeliads form dense colonies in the landscape, which is a
dry sandy habitat (_restinga_ vegetation). The landscape is composed of large
semi-open patches of shrubs which form shady patches interspersed with a very
exposed, sandy habitat. Bromeliad taxa here are known to contain diverse
communities of macroinvertebrates, zooplankton and bacteria; these communities
show strong habitat differences for macroinvertebrates, weaker differences for
zooplankton and none for bacteria (Farjalla et al. 2010).

We created our starting communities by sampling six bromeliads and then
redistributing their macroinvertebrate fauna and a water sample (for zooplankton
and bacteria). We refer to these starting compositions as "homogenized".
Macroinvertebrate communities were sampled by washing the plants thoroughly and
sieving the water through (dimensions) mesh.  They were then identified to the
lowest taxonomic level possible in the field (genus or family).  Homogenized
communities were the arithmetic mean of the densities of each group in original
communities (though often lower due to of natural mortality). To homogenize
zooplankton, protist and bacteria communities, we collected an equal volume of
inoculum from each plant, mixed and returned equal volumes to all bromeliads.
In our first experiment we used 100ml of inoculum from each plant, because _A.
nudicaulis_ is very small and this was the maximum volume we could obtain while
simultaneously selecting average-sized plants.

All bromeliads were sterilized, returned to their original habitat and stocked
with the homogenized community. We sterilized plants by thoroughly rinsing them
with water, followed by 70% ethanol, and then hanging them upside down to dry
overnight. A bromeliad dissected after this process contained no insects. Plants
were replaced in a similar local habitat to their original, and enclosed in a
2mm mesh cage to prevent colonization by insects.

We sampled and preserved all macroinvertebrates, and a sample of zooplankton and
bacteria, at the end of the experiment. Macroinvertebrates were identified while
live and preserved in ethanol.  Zooplankton were collected on 50-micron Nytex
mesh and fixed in 5% buffered formalin. Subsamples (>100 individuals) were then
identified to the lowest taxonomic unit possible (species in most cases, except
for bdelloid rotifers and harpaticoid copepods, left at the level of class and
order, respectively). We measured bacterial community composition using
denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE; Muyzer et al. 1993). This
analysis furnishes an approximation of bacterial diversity in the form of
Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). In all our collection methods we stayed as
close as possible to techniques used in the previous observational work
(Farjalla et al. 2010).

We performed two statistical tests: a permutation test (PERMANOVA) to detect
differences in the degree of environmental signal among groups, and a
multivariate regression of abundance to identify those taxa which contributed
most to the differences. PERMANOVA measures the amount of difference in
community composition between treatment groups and compares this to the expected
distribution under a null hypothesis.
