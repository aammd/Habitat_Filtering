## Abstract

Species composition of local communities often varies in response to
differences in the environment. Local organisms are "filtered" from the
regional species pool when their sensitivity to local environmental conditions
prevents their establishment or persistence. However, not all groups of
organisms are equally sensitive to the same environmental variation.
Observational studies have already suggested that larger-bodied species are
more strongly filtered by habitat than smaller- bodied species. However, this
mechanism has never been tested experimentally. In our study we placed highly
similar aquatic communities (composed of insects, zooplankton and bacteria)
into different environments and observed subsequent divergence in composition.
We predicted that insects would show a strong change in composition,
zooplankton a moderate change and bacteria little to no change. Our results are
consistent with these predictions, with the exception of a weaker signal in
insects than expected. These results suggest that organism size could provide
a framework for integrating studies of environmental filtering across
different scales and systems.

## Introduction

Community composition of local patches varies in response to the environment;
however not all species within a community respond in the same degree.
"Habitat filtering" occurs when qualities of the habitat (abiotic or biotic)
prevent species from colonizing or persisting in a habitat. In contrast,
neutral models of biodiversity consider all individuals in a community to be
demographically equivalent; differences in species composition are therefore
the result of dispersal and demographic stochasticity. This has led to the
approach of partitioning variance in community composition into variation
correlated with space, with environmental distance, or with their interaction.
These studies have returned mixed results for different groups of organisms
and systems (Cottenie). In one of the first studies across different groups of
organisms in the same community, Farjalla et al (2012) demonstrated that body
size is a key trait determining environmental signal in community composition.
They found that larger bodied organisms show a greater degree of
habitat filtering: there is weaker environmental structure as body size
decreases from insects (strong signal), zooplankton (moderate signal) and bacteria
(weak signal).

Why should the strength of environmental filtering decrease with organism
size? There are two possible mechanisms that may make communities of smaller
organisms less strongly filtered: increased dispersal rates and increased
plasticity. Dispersal rates increase when smaller organisms are easily
passively carried (e.g. by wind). Increased dispersal brings new immigrants
into a community, many of whom may not be able to persist without the constant
supply of new immigrants. These "source-sink" dynamics (Leibold) can lead to
similarity between patches even when their environments favour different
community compositions. Increased plasticity, on the other hand, occurs when
smaller-bodied species have broader fundamental niches than larger-bodied
species in the same community. This is the "size-plasticity" hypothesis of
Farjalla et al (2012). Bacteria and other small organisms are broadly
generalist in their ability to consume carbon sources and persist in different
climates (Finlay 2002) and are less constrained by the complex physiological
pathways posessed by larger metazoans. Additionally, smaller-bodied organisms
have shorter generation times and generally larger populations, which may
allow them the opportunity to evolve to a novel environment more rapidly than
larger-bodied organisms.

The size-plasticity hypothesis makes a testable prediction about the
consequences of environmental variation for similar communities: community
composition will become diverge in different environments, but this divergence
will be greatest between larger species and increasingly weak in smaller
organisms. To test these predictions, we performed a manipulative experiment
in the same habitat as Farjalla et al. (2012). We studied the same groups of
organisms (insects, zooplankton and bacteria) in the same patchy, highly
variable habitat (three species of tank bromeliads). We created communities
that were as similar as possible in composition, then exposed these
communities to their original environmental conditions. We predicted community
change to be greater and more consistent in insects, less strong in
zooplankton and absent in bacteria. If instead differences in communities are
driven by spatial processes we will see no difference in the strength of
environmental signal across all groups.

## Methods

We performed two complementary experiments to test how different groups within
these communities respond to environmental variation. In the first, we
contrasted communities from different bromeliad species and habitats (between-species experiment), while in
the second we contrasted communities from a single generalist bromeliad (within-species experiment). 

* that was a good idea because the first experiment combines differences caused by bromeliad species and local habitat into one, while the other allows us to separate brom species from habitat.

This allows us to separate the effects of bromeliad species identity from
habitat in our two analyses.


### Study site and bromeliad species

* We focussed on there are three species of bromeliads from contrasting habitats.
* these are the same species which were used in the Farjalla et al study.
*  Each species was collected from a habitat where they are commonly found: _Aechmea nudicaulis_ (full sun habitats),
_Vriesea neoglutinosa_ (partial shade), and _Neoregelia cruenta_ (deep shade).
* However, all species show some variation, occuring in many different habitats; the extreme case is Neoregelia, which is so common and broadly distributed that it overlaps with all other species.
* That made Neoregelia a good choice for our within-species experiment.

* because _A. nudicaulis_ is very small and this was
the maximum volume we could obtain while simultaneously selecting average-
sized plants.

We performed our experiments at the Parque Nacional de Jurubatiba, Northeast
Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. The landscape is composed of large semi-open
patches of shrubs which form shady patches interspersed with very exposed,
sunny habitats. Bromeliads form dense colonies in the landscape, which is
a dry sandy habitat (_restinga_ vegetation). The landscape is composed of
large semi-open patches of shrubs which form shady patches interspersed with a
very exposed, sandy habitat. Bromeliad taxa here are known to contain diverse
communities of macroinvertebrates, zooplankton and bacteria; these communities
show strong habitat differences for macroinvertebrates, weaker differences for
zooplankton and none for bacteria (Farjalla et al. 2010).

Topic: Each experimental block contained six bromeliads from contrasting conditions.

We created our starting communities by sampling six bromeliads (between-
species: two of each species; within-species: three from each habitat) and
then redistributing their macroinvertebrate fauna and a water inoculum for
zooplankton and bacteria. We refer to these starting communities as
"homogenized". Macroinvertebrate communities were sampled by washing the
plants throughly and seiving the water through 1mm and 180Âµm mesh. They were
then identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible in the field (genus or
family). Homogenized communities were the arithmetic mean of the densities
of each group in original communities (though often lower due to natural
mortality). To homogenize zooplankton, protist and bacteria communities, we
collected an equal volume of inoculum from each plant, mixed and returned
equal volumes to all bromeliads. In our first experiment we used 100ml of
inoculum from each plant, standardizing the volume drawn from each. 

The experiment lasted for 2 weeks.

All bromeliads were sterilized, returned to their original habitat and stocked
with the homogenized community. We sterilized plants by thoroughly rinsing them
with water, followed by 70% ethanol, and then hanging them upside down to dry
overnight. We confirmed that this technique removed all invertebrates and most detritus by dissecting a steralized bromeliad. A bromeliad dissected after this process contained no insects. Plants
were replaced in a similar local habitat to their original, and enclosed in a
2mm mesh cage to prevent colonization by insects.

We sampled and preserved all macroinvertebrates, and a sample of zooplankton and
bacteria, at the end of the experiment. Macroinvertebrates were identified while
live and preserved in ethanol.  Zooplankton were collected on 50-micron Nytex
mesh and fixed in 5% buffered formalin. Subsamples (>100 individuals) were then
identified to the lowest taxonomic unit possible (species in most cases, except
for bdelloid rotifers and harpaticoid copepods, left at the level of class and
order, respectively). We measured bacterial community composition using
denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE; Muyzer et al. 1993). This
analysis furnishes an approximation of bacterial diversity in the form of
Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). In all our collection methods we stayed as
close as possible to techniques used in the previous observational work
(Farjalla et al. 2010).

### Analyses

<!-- hypotheses you tested and what type of results you were
expecting -->

We performed two statistical tests: a permutation test (PERMANOVA) to detect
differences in the degree of environmental signal among groups, and a
multivariate regression of abundance to identify those taxa which contributed
most to the differences. PERMANOVA measures the amount of difference in
community composition between treatment groups and compares this to the expected
distribution under a null hypothesis.
