## Abstract

At the local scale, species composition of often varies among habitat patches in
response to differences in environmental variables. These differences act as
"filters": organisms cannot occur in a habitat patch when their sensitivity to
local environmental conditions prevents their establishment or persistence.
However, not all groups of organisms are equally sensitive to the same
environmental variables. Observational studies have already suggested that
larger-bodied species are more strongly filtered by habitat than smaller- bodied
species. However, this mechanism has never been tested experimentally. In our
study we placed highly similar aquatic communities (composed of insects,
zooplankton and bacteria) into different environments and observed subsequent
divergence in composition. We predicted that insects would show a strong change
in composition, zooplankton a moderate change and bacteria little to no change.
Our results are consistent with these predictions, with the exception of a
weaker signal in insects than expected. These results suggest that organism size
could provide a framework for integrating studies of environmental filtering
across different scales and systems.

## Introduction

models of community assembly explain how local species composition are assembled from the regional species pool. They can be divided into neutral and niche-based processes. Neutral processes are based on the demographic equivalence of all species. the relative abundance of species in any local patch is dependent on their frequency in the regional species pool, paired with stochastic demographic processes such as immigration and emigration. In contrast, niche-based models of community assembly emphasize the trait differences among species. In these models, species are able to coexiest if they posses sufficeniently different traits (stabilizing processes) and their relative abundance is due to differences in their fitness (e.g. survival and reproduction). Niche-based models emphasize how the presence of species in a site is correlated with the abiotic and biotic conditions of that site. These determine whether a species is able to colonize or persist in a given patch. In niche-based, as in neutral models, variance in community composition is also derived from stochasticity in demographic processes. Both categorite of model also make predictions about how patches differ from each other in species composition (beta diversity). In a neutral model, differences between patches are caused by stochasticity in demographic processes, particularly dispersa.  In a niche-based model this variation is increased by variation among habitat patches, which selects for different species compositions in each. Separating the different patterns produced by these two methods usually involves variance partitioning. This approach has its detractors. But the question remains for ecologists: when and under what circumstances will local communities be assembled by neutral or niche-based processes? 

 In one of the first studies across different groups of
organisms in the same community, Farjalla et al. [-@Farjalla2012] demonstrated that body
size is a key trait determining environmental signal in community composition. They conducted an observational study across many different organism types, spanning orders of magnitude in body size, along a single environmental gradient. They considered two different hypotheses regarding how increasing body size should change the balance of niche-based vs neutral community assembly processes. The size-dispersal and size-plasticity hypotheses. The former hypothesis suggests that larger animals have weaker dispersal -- therefore more stochasticity in community composition -- while smaller organisms have such high dispersal rates that variation in composition must be driven by the suitability of the local environment. In contrast the size-plasticity hypothesis suggests that more important than the ability to disperse is the differences in the local environment. That is, smaller organisms should be less sensitive to environmental variation (ie more plastic) and larger organisms more so. They found that groups of organisms which are physically larger show a greater degree of
habitat filtering: there is weaker environmental structure as body size
decreases from insects (strong signal), zooplankton (moderate signal) and bacteria
(weak signal). Their analysis of observational data found support for the size-plasticity hypothesis.

Why should the strenght of environmental filtering decrease with organism size? there are two possible mechanisms that may make communities of smaller organisms more strongly filtered. At the individual level, organisms which are very small maybe able to find microhabitats in a way that mitigates varation abmong patches. smaller organisms also have simpler metabolisms. Bacteria are often able to consume a wide variety of carbon sources. Bacteria can even use environmental DNA, or transfer plasmids among unrelated cells, acquiring new functions. 

The individual-level effects suggested by the size-plasticity hypothesis are difficult to test because of population level processes: especially dispersal. At the population level, smaller organisms may also show less of a relationship with environmental variation. if smaller organisms disperse more rapidly, then we would expect to see populations of smaller species maintained, even in patches where they have negative population growth rates (i.e. mass effects). smaller organisms have higher growth rates, higher rates of turnover, and shorter generation times. This suggests that they could persiste in highly variable or fluctuation habitats, purely by demographic processes. Also, they could stick aroun by evolution, as they have larger effects population sizes (does mutation rate show an effect with regard to population size?). rapid evolution to antiobotics is well know.
In both cases, therefore, space is an issue -- the processes of dispersal can either exaggerate or diminish the effects seen by Farjalla et al. 

However, the work of Farjalla et al suggests a manipulative experiment: to
remove variation among patches, while preserving abiotic variation. If these
environmental differences. We studied the same groups of organisms (insects,
zooplankton and bacteria) in the same patchy, highly variable habitat (three
species of tank bromeliads). We created communities that were as similar as
possible in composition, then exposed these communities to their original
environmental conditions.



We test three different predictions of the size-plasticity hypothesis: 

Question 1: communities which begin at a simiar species composition will diverge, but this divergence
will be greatest between larger species and increasingly weak in smaller
organisms

Question 2: This increase in beta diversity will correlate with environmental differences; this correlation will be stronger for larger organisms.

Question 3: The specific taxa responding to environmental variation will possess traits that are related to their ability to sustain highly variable environments.




## Methods

### Study site

We performed our experiments at the Parque Nacional de Jurubatiba, Northeast Rio
de Janeiro state, Brazil ($22^{\circ}$ S $41^{\circ}$). The landscape is
composed of large semi-open patches of shrubs which form shady patches
interspersed with very exposed, sunny habitats (_restinga_ vegetation).
Bromeliads (Bromeliaceae) form dense colonies within this landscape. The
landscape is composed of large semi-open clumps of shrubs interspersed with very
exposed, open sand. Several bromeliad taxa here collect standing water
(phytotelmata) in deep leaf axils, and are known to contain diverse communities 
of macroinvertebrates, zooplankton and bacteria.

### Experimental design

We used the same three bromeliad used by Farjalla et al. [-@Farjalla2012].
Each bromeliad species was collected from its typical habitat: _Aechmea
nudicaulis_ (full sun habitats), _Vriesea neoglutinosa_ (partial shade), and
_Neoregelia cruenta_ (full shade). _Neoregelia_ has a uniquely large habitat
range at this site, occuring in both full shade and full sun; only shade
plants were used in this study. We created five blocks; each block consisted
of six bromeliads, two from each species. We combined their communities and filled each bromeliad with an identical starting community (see `r fig("design")`. We made these starting communities by sampling, then
combining, each of three major groups: macroinvertebrates, zooplankton and
bacteria.

`r fig_nums("design", "This is the design of the experiment.")`


**Initial collection**: We sampled macroinvertebrates by thoroughly rinsing
each bromeliad and passing the water through 1mm and 180μm mesh to collect
aquatic macroinvertebrates. These mesh sizes have been shown to separate macro
invertebrates from both coarse detritus and fine particulate organic matter,
facilitating their collection. We identified macroinvertebrates to
morphospecies. We sampled the zooplankton and bacteria communities by
collecting a water sample from each bromeliad: 100ml for zooplankton, 50ml for
bacteria. Zooplankton were collected by filtering on 50-micron Nytex mesh and
fixed in 5% buffered formalin. This fixed solution was then diluted to 20 ml,
and a 1 ml subsample taken for analysis. Zooplankton were  identified to the
lowest taxonomic unit possible (species in most cases, except for bdelloid
rotifers and harpaticoid copepods, left at the level of class and order,
respectively). Bacteria were collected by taking some of the filtrate from the
zooplankton sample and filtering it a second time on a Whatman filter paper.
We measured bacterial community composition using denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis (DGGE; Muyzer et al. 1993). This analysis furnishes an
approximation of bacterial diversity in the form of Operational Taxonomic
Units (OTUs). **Bromeliad preparation**: We emptied bromeliads by hanging them
upside down to dry for at least 24 hours and then rinsing each plant with 70%
ethanol. Any coarse detritus found in the bromeliads was similarly cleaned,
frozen and thawed (to kill any macroinvertebrates eggs). We confirmed that
this technique removed all invertebrates and most detritus by dissecting an
empty bromeliad. Bromeliads were placed in a local habitat similar to their
original, each enclosed in a 2mm mesh cage to prevent colonization by insects.
We then added the starting communities of macroinvertebrates, zooplankton and
bacteria. **Initial communities**: we created initial communities of
zooplankton and microbes by mixing an equal volume of filtered tank water from
each plant (approximately 100ml plant^-1^), returning the same volumes to all
bromeliads.

The experiment lasted for 12 days, after which we collected all
macroinvertebrates, and a sample of zooplankton and bacteria. Throughout our
analysis we used collection methods consistent as possible with Farjalla et
al. [-@Farjalla2012], to facilitate a direct comparison .


### Analyses

We used a different analysis for each question we posed. For question 1, we
used the `betadisper` function in the R package vegan [@vegan]. We used a
permutation test to test for differences before and after the experiment
within each block (999 null simulations block^-1^). All statistical analyses
were conducted in R [@rcore]. We tested question 2 with a permutational ANOVA
(PERMANOVA) to detect differences in the degree of environmental signal among
groups. PERMANOVA measures the amount of difference in community composition
between treatment groups and compares this to the expected distribution under
a null hypothesis of no treatment effects. If larger-bodied groups of
organisms are more filtered, then we expect to find a greater difference in
community composition emerge among the macroinvertebrates, less among the
zooplankton, and little to none among bacteria. We complemented this approach
in question 3 with a multivariate regression of abundance [@mvabund] to
identify those taxa which contributed most to the differences.


## Results  

Goal 1: dispersion differences among the different organism groups.  

We hypothesized that smaller organism types should recover less dispersion than larger ones. This can be tested with the interaction between timing of sampling (intial vs final) and organism type. We measured dispersion (distance to centroid) for all five blocks before and after the experiment (Mixed effect model, F~2,20~ = `r getFP_aov(tidy_mixed, "Fvalue", "taxa:timing")`, `r check_aov_p(tidy_mixed, "taxa:timing")`). However, we did see an overall decrease in the dispersion at the end of the experiment (F~1,20~ = `r getFP_aov(tidy_mixed, "Fvalue", "timing")`, `r check_aov_p(tidy_mixed, "timing")`).

Question 2: 

Our interspecific experiment found a large effect of bromeliad species on the community composition of invertebrates, then less and less for zooplankon and bacteria (`r fig_nums("bw_spp")` ). We tested this by performing six PERMANOVAs, summarized in `r tab("perm_3sp")`.

## Discussion

We did discover different amounts of environmental signal ithe different groups -- more in invertebrates and zooplankton than in bacteria. In the direction that we expected, based on the size-sensitivity hypothesis. We found support for these same patterns when we examined individual species responses -- more species of insects showed a change in response to environmental variation than did zooplankton. No bacteria OTU ever showed a predictable difference between before and after. Just as Farjalla et al predicted, the strength of environmental fitlering is in negative proportion to body size. Over the same time interval, insects and zooplankton developed more of a response to the environment than did bacteria. 

We found that dispersion, in all cases, was lower at the end of the experiment than at the beginning. This indicates that our treatments were effectingve in removing beta diverstiy among patches. that is, that all habitats really did end up being very similar at the beginning, as we would expect. However, the amount of this decline was the same across all organism groups (`r tab("disp_tab")`), as indicated by the 

The difference between insects and zooplankton was not as great as we expected it would be. that was probably because we were missing the active vs passive differences. Insect females choose where to place their eggs, evalutating resources and predation risk (citecitecite). On the other hand, the macroinvertebrate taxa that did respond are also the more abundant taxa; it may be that we only had the ability to detect patterns for these taxa. Both of these issues at once (should we do permanova on mortality?). Both size does predict some of the variation in response to the environment. Since active dispersers are also larger, there is then a relationship between that life history and body size -- larger animals are more likely to disperse actively. It may be that those groups show a response in that direction as well. 

In conclusion, here we have shown that a hypothesis made by variance partitioning and by observations, can be supported by a manipulative experiment and a different statistical approach. that, I guess, is probably good news for variance partitioning methods, which have come under a lot of criticism lately. iN our experiment we removed the variation in community composition between habitats, and were essentially able to watch the recovery of beta diversity in our system. Measured as both turnover and dispersion, in that test I haven't even done yet. 

In other words our experiment has not only confirmed some aspects of the body size habitat senstivity experiment, but also investigated the rate at which beta diversity is recovered for these different groups. p
