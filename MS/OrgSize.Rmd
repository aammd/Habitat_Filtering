## Abstract

At the local scale, species composition often varies among habitat patches in
response to differences in environmental variables. These differences act as
"filters": organisms cannot occur in a habitat patch when their sensitivity to
local environmental conditions prevents their establishment or persistence.
However, not all groups of organisms are equally sensitive to the same
environmental variables. Observational studies have already suggested that
larger-bodied species are more strongly filtered by habitat than smaller-bodied
species. However, this mechanism has never been tested experimentally. In our
study we placed highly similar aquatic communities (composed of insects,
zooplankton and bacteria) into different environments and observed subsequent
divergence in composition. We predicted that insects would show a strong change
in composition, zooplankton a moderate change and bacteria little to no change.
Our results are consistent with these predictions, with the exception of a
weaker signal in insects than expected. These results suggest that organism size
could provide a framework for integrating studies of environmental filtering
across different scales and systems.

## Introduction

When can we use environmental variation to predict community structure?
Models of community assembly describe how local communities are assembled from
the regional species pool; they can be divided into neutral and niche-based
processes. These two frameworks make very different predictions about how the
environment influences community structure. In neutral models, individuals of
all species are assumed to be demographically equivalent, with patterns of
relative abundance being driven by stochastic processes: birth, death and
dispersal. Because dispersal is a spatial process, neutral models predict that
sites close in space should be most similar in community composition. In
contrast, niche-based models of community assembly emphasize differences among sites (i.e. in habitat qualities) and differences among species (i.e. in traits). In these models, species are able to coexist if they
possess traits which permit them to colonize, and if they are sufficiently
different from other species to allow coexistence. Niche-based models,
therefore, predict that sites similar in biotic and abiotic conditions should be
most similar in community composition. There have been many studies evaluating the relative
importance of niche versus neutral processes. But the question remains for
ecologists: when and under what circumstances will local communities be
assembled by neutral or niche-based processes?

One promising mechanism for answering this question is the Size-Plasticity
Hypothesis [@Farjalla2012]. This hypothesis suggests that smaller organisms
are more plastic than larger organisms, and therefore smaller organisms show
more neutral dynamics of community assembly. In one of the first studies
comparing different organism types in the same community, Farjalla et al.
[-@Farjalla2012] observed three different organism types: macroinvertebrates,
zooplankton and bacteria. These organism types span orders of magnitude in
body size, and multiple species of each are found along the same environmental
gradient -- in this case, three different species of tank bromeliads. They
considered two different hypotheses regarding how increasing body size should
change the balance of niche-based vs neutral community assembly processes: the
size-dispersal and size-plasticity hypotheses. The former hypothesis suggests
that larger organism types have weaker dispersal, which creates more spatial
signal in community composition. Smaller organisms, meanwhile, have high
dispersal rates, which creates more opportunity for the environment to
structure community composition. That is, the size-dispersal hypothesis
predicts that size is negatively correlated with the importance of niche-based
processes. The size-plasticity hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests the
opposite pattern: smaller organisms should be less sensitive to environmental
variation (i.e. more plastic) and larger organisms more so. Their analysis of
observational data found support for the size- plasticity hypothesis. They
found that groups of organisms which are physically larger show a greater
degree of habitat filtering: there is weaker environmental structure as body
size decreases from insects (strong signal), zooplankton (moderate signal) and
bacteria (weak signal).

Why should the strength of environmental filtering decrease with organism
size? There are two possible mechanisms that may make communities of smaller
organisms more strongly filtered. First, at the individual level, organisms
may have behavioral or physiological plasticity which permits them to persist
in a patch, even if the environment changes. For example, small organisms may
be able to find microhabitats that allow them to persist when the rest of a
local habitat is unsuitable. Small organisms may also have a wide dietary
plasticity -- for example, a single bacteria taxon can often consume a wide
variety of carbon sources. Bacteria can even use environmental DNA, or
transfer plasmids among unrelated cells, acquiring new functions. Second, at
the level of the population, demographic processes can contribute to the
amount of sensitivity a group will show. Smaller organisms have higher growth
rates, higher rates of turnover, and shorter generation times. This suggests
that they could persist in highly variable or fluctuation habitats, purely by
demographic processes. However, most importantly the process of dispersal can
counteract habitat filtering. If smaller organisms disperse more rapidly, then
we would expect to see populations of smaller species maintained, even in
patches where they have negative population growth rates (i.e. mass effects).

Dispersal creates a problem for measuring the distinction between the size-
plasticity and size-dispersal hypotheses. Dispersal can be active, where
adults choose where to lay eggs, or passive, when that organisms are moved by
some vector. On the one hand, active choice by larger organism types could
account for much of the pattern seen by Farjalla et al - particularly if the
scale and precision of active dispersal increases with organism size. This
behaviour by female insects may result in their offspring being found in very
similar locations, creating an environmental signal in their distribution.  On
the other hand, high rates of even passive dispersal have the possibility to
maintain local populations of a species though mass effects. For example, a
given zooplankton species may experience negative growth rate in one patch,
but a constant influx of new immigrants maintains its presence. Unfortunately,
dispersal rates are notoriously difficult to measure, especially for the many
species and scales necessary to address this question.

Fortunately, the size-dispersal and size-plasticity also make different
predictions regarding the rate of change in communities which begin at
identical (or nearly-identical). We use this prediction to design and
experiment: by starting with identical community compositions, we will observe
the return of variation in community composition. We studied the same groups
of organisms (insects, zooplankton and bacteria) in the same patchy, highly
variable habitat (three species of tank bromeliads). We created communities
that were as similar as possible in composition, then exposed these
communities to their original environmental conditions.

We test three different predictions of the size-plasticity hypothesis: 

Question 1: communities which begin at a similar species composition will diverge, but this divergence
will be greatest between larger species and increasingly weak in smaller
organisms

Question 2: This increase in beta diversity will correlate with environmental differences; this correlation will be stronger for larger organisms.

Question 3: The specific taxa responding to environmental variation will possess traits that are related to their ability to sustain highly variable environments.

## Methods

### Experimental design

Our goal is to investigate the patterns observed by Farjalla et al.
[-@Farjalla2012], therefore we performed this experiment in the same location
along the same environmental variation. The location we used is the Parque
Nacional de Jurubatiba, Northeast Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil ($22^{\circ}$ S
$41^{\circ}$); the environmental gradient is three different species of
bromeliad. Each species of bromeliad is found in a different habitat of the
park: _Aechmea nudicaulis_ (full sun habitats), _Vriesea neoglutinosa_
(partial shade), and _Neoregelia cruenta_ (full shade). _Neoregelia_ has a
uniquely large habitat range at this site, occurring in both full shade and
full sun; only shade plants were used in this study. As is common for
bromeliads, plants used in this study collect standing water (phytotelmata) in
deep leaf axils, and are known to contain diverse communities  of
macroinvertebrates, zooplankton and bacteria.

```{r}
str_end <- blocks %>% 
	filter(experiment == "threespp") %>% 
	select(setup.date) %>% 
	mutate(sdate = ymd(setup.date)) %>% 
	filter(sdate %in% range(sdate)) %>% 
	.[["setup.date"]]
```

We homogenized the community of macroinvertebrates, zooplankton and bacteria
among all three bromeliad species. We collected six bromeliads -- two of each
species -- sampled them, and mixed their communities together (see `r fig("design")`, description of sampling below.).  Our goal was to create identical starting community composition for all bromeliads within a block. Variation between blocks in starting community composition is thus included in the random effect of blocks. We created five blocks in this experiment between `r str_end[[1]]` and `r str_end[[2]]`.

![img](../photos/text_design.png) `r fig_nums("design", "A schematic of our
experimental design. In our initial collection (1) we sampled six bromeliads
(two each of the three species shown here). We formed homogeneous initial communities (2) by counting equal numbers of animals (macroinvertebrates) or by mixing water samples of equal volume from all plants (zooplankton and bacteria). We then returned these initial communities to the six bromeliads (3), and replaced the bromeliads in their original habitats.")`

Our experimental setup consisted of three steps (`r fig("design")`): initial
collection, forming initial communities, and replacing them in their original
(now empty) bromeliads. **Initial collection**: We sampled macroinvertebrates
by thoroughly rinsing each bromeliad and passing the water through 1mm and
180μm mesh to collect aquatic macroinvertebrates. These mesh sizes have been
shown to separate macro invertebrates from both coarse detritus and fine
particulate organic matter, facilitating their collection. We identified
macroinvertebrates to morphospecies. We sampled the zooplankton and bacteria
communities by collecting a water sample from each bromeliad: 100ml for
zooplankton, 50ml for bacteria. Zooplankton were collected by filtering on
50-micron Nytex mesh and fixed in 5% buffered formalin. This fixed solution
was then diluted to 20 ml, and a 1 ml subsample taken for analysis.
Zooplankton were  identified to the lowest taxonomic unit possible (species in
most cases, except for bdelloid rotifers and harpaticoid copepods, left at the
level of class and order, respectively). Bacteria were collected by taking
some of the filtrate from the zooplankton sample and filtering it a second
time on a Whatman filter paper. We measured bacterial community composition
using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE, Muyzer et al. [@Muyzer1993]). This
technique measures an approximation of bacterial diversity in the form of
Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). **Initial communities**: we created
initial communities of zooplankton and microbes by mixing an equal volume of
filtered tank water from each plant (approximately 100ml plant^-1^), then dividing this mixed volume among all individual bromeliads. To create initial communities of macroinvertebrates, we simply counted them all and divided them equally among all bromeliads. **Bromeliad preparation**: We emptied
bromeliads by washing them thoroughly, hanging them upside down to dry for at least 24 hours and then
rinsing each plant with 70% ethanol. Any coarse detritus found in the
bromeliads was similarly cleaned, frozen and thawed (to kill any
macroinvertebrates eggs). We confirmed that this technique removed all
invertebrates and most detritus by dissecting an empty bromeliad. Bromeliads
were placed in a local habitat similar to their original: _Neoregelica_ in shade, _Aechmea_ in full sun and _Vresia_ in marginal habitat. We then added the starting
communities of macroinvertebrates, zooplankton and bacteria.

Bromeliads are an open system, characterized by continual colonization and
emergence. Both of these processes are problematic for our question: if we
were to allow colonization it could swamp any changes in our starting
community composition. Conversely, if we allowed the experiment to continue
for too long any macroinvertebrates with complex life cycles would emerge,
leaving us with no community to sample [@Lecraw2014]. We took two steps to
make sure that our treatment effects were not affected by colonization or
excessive emergence. To prevent colonization we surrounded bromeliads with
mosquito netting (mesh size approx. 1.5 mm). To prevent emergence we ended our
experiment after 12 days, based on the results of a pilot study that
confirmed that this was sufficient time for treatments to change, but not so
long that bromeliads were empty.


### Analyses

*Question 1: less beta diversity among smaller organism types* If smaller taxa
are more plastic, we should see less variation in community composition among
bromeliads for smaller organism types. That is, we should see less beta
diversity among bromeliads at the end of the experiment than we saw at the
beginning. We tested this by calculating multivariate dispersions
[@Anderson2006] between all six bromeliads (i.e. distances to centroid of all bromeliads within one block) before and
after the experiment. We repeated this comparison for all five blocks, and for
all three organism types. We used the `betadisper` function in the R package
vegan [@vegan], which provides a permutation test to test for differences in
dispersion before and after the experiment within each block (999 null
simulations block^-1^). For the purposes of this analysis, we used the Raup-Crick measure of dissimilarity. We extracted the mean distance to centroid `r fig("disp")` for each block before and after the experiment. We did this because our hypothesis concerns an interaction: specifically, that the difference in mean distance to centroid (i.e. the slopes of lines in `r fig("disp")`) decline with decreasing organism size. This allowed us to test these differences with a mixed effect linear model including the main effect of sampling time (before and after) organism type (macroinvertebrate, zooplankton and bacteria) and their interaction, with a random effect for block.

*Question 2: less environmental signal among smaller organism types*
The size-plastisicy hypothesis predicts that variation in communiy composition among bromeliads should be more correlated with environment for larger organism types. This correlation should be weaker for smaller groups. We tested this hypothesis with a permutational ANOVA (PERMANOVA), which measures the amount of difference
in community composition between treatment groups and compares this to the
expected distribution under a null hypothesis of no treatment effects. In each PERMANOVA we used block as an error strata, meaning that permutations were performed within blocks. We repeated this analysis for all three organism groups, and at both "initial" and "final" sampling dates (i.e. at the beginning and end of the experiment).

*Question 3: Particular traits are correlated with environmental signal*

The distance-based approaches described above test the response of the whole
community, but community-level responses are often driven by the response of a
smaller number of species. These species often posses particular traits which
correlate with their responses. We tested this hypothesis with multivariate
generalized linear models [@mvabund], which is a  model-based multivariate
alternative to distance-based methods [@Warton2012]. This technique is implemented in the R package `mvabund`  [@Wang2012;@mvabund]. We used this approach to fit the model:

$log(\mu_{jkl}) =  intercept_{j} + block_{jk} + bromeliad_{jl} + block \times bromeliad_{jkl}$

Where $\mu_{jkl}$ is the response of species $j$ in block $k$ to the environment of bromeliad $l$. This model is used to predict the mean of a negative binomial distribution: 

$Y_{ij} \sim NegBin(\mu_{jkl}, \phi_{j})$

Here, $Y_{ij}$ is the abundance of species $j$ in plant $i$. The dispersion parameter, $\phi_{j}$, measures the variablity of species $j$ (constant across sites). We fit these models to final community composition only.

This approach has three advantages that make it suitable for our application.
First, because it is based on GLMs, we are able to model the mean-variance
relationship common in count data. This characteristic of count data is often
problematic for distance-based metrics, which can conflate differences in
dispersion with differences in location [@Warton2012]. We are already testing
for dispersion and location effects in the separate analysis described above
with distance based methods. Therefore this multivariate GLM approach helps
confirm our findings by accounting for both within a different framework.
Second, because it is model-based, it allows us to test for an interaction
between our treatments (different bromeliad species) and blocks. Significance
in these tests is generated by permutation tests based on 1000 replications.
Third, mvabund also allows for estimating individual species-level responses, via a correction for repeated family-level testing [@Wang2012].
This lets us identify which species responded most to the environmental
differences, and to relate these to traits of these species. 

All statistical analyses were conducted in R [@rcore]. Code to reproduce the analysis published here is available at ***link to data***

```

*Question 1: less beta diversity among smaller organism types*
All organism groups showed the same decrease in mean distance to centroid at the end of the experiment -- there was no significant interaction between organism type and the effect of sampling time (`r fig("disp")`, Mixed effect model F~2,20~ = `r getFP_aov(tidy_mixed, "Fvalue", "taxa:timing")`, `r check_aov_p(tidy_mixed, "taxa:timing")`). However, we did see a `r pdiff`% decrease in the dispersion at the end of the experiment (F~1,20~ = `r getFP_aov(tidy_mixed, "Fvalue", "timing")`, `r check_aov_p(tidy_mixed, "timing")`).

*Question 2: less environmental signal among smaller organism types*
Bromeliad species identity explains more variation in community composition of invertebrates, and less and less for zooplankon and bacteria (`r fig_nums("bw_spp")` ). We tested this by performing six PERMANOVAs, summarized in `r tab("perm_3sp")`. For all organism types, the bromeliad species explained less of the variation at the end of the experiment than at the beginning. For macroinvertebrates, bromelaid species explained around 30% of the variation at the beginning and end of the experiment (R^2^ of `r inv_r2["ini"]` and `r inv_r2["fin"]`, respectively), while explaining less in zooplankton (`r zoops_r2["ini"]` and `r zoops_r2["fin"]`) and very little in bacteria (`r bact_r2["ini"]` and `r bact_r2["fin"]`).


*Question 3: Particular traits are correlated with environmental signal*
```{r echo=FALSE}

extract_tab <- function(mglmtab, .term){
	mglmtab %>% 
 	 filter(term == .term) %>% 
 	 .[["Dev"]] %>% 
 	 sprintf("%.2f", .)
}

inverts_interact <- extract_tab(inverts_manyglm_table, "Block:species")
zoops_interact <- extract_tab(zoops_manyglm_table, "Block:species")
bact_interact <- extract_tab(bact_manyglm_table, "Block:species")
```
We wanted to use the manyglm approach to measure test if smaller organism types respond less to the same environmental gradient than larger ones. To do this, we measured the percent of the total deviance explained by the combination of $bromeliad_{jl}$ and $block \times bromeliad_{jkl}$ terms in our model. These terms explained high proportions of deviance for insects and zooplankton (`r percent_dev_sp(inverts_manyglm_table)` and `r percent_dev_sp(zoops_manyglm_table)`, respectively) and less for bacteria (`r percent_dev_sp(bact_manyglm_table)`). This agrees with our hypothesis, and with the PERMANOVA results reported above. We were obliged to combine terms for this analysis, because there was always a significant interaction between block and species in our models (ie, we could not examine main effects of species independently; See Supplementary Material).

## Discussion

We tested three predictions of the size-plasticity hypothesis. First, we tested whether smaller organism types would develop less variation than larger organisms. We did not find support for this pattern. Second, we asked whether smaller organisms showed a weaker relationship to environmental variation than larger organisms. We found this pattern in two different multivariate tests of our final sample. Third, we asked which taxa were driving the response, and found that chironomids, oligochaetes and one zooplankton species in particular explained more of the deviance in multivariate response. 

We did discover different amounts of environmental signal ithe different groups -- more in invertebrates and zooplankton than in bacteria. In the direction that we expected, based on the size-sensitivity hypothesis. We found support for these same patterns when we examined individual species responses -- more species of insects showed a change in response to environmental variation than did zooplankton. No bacteria OTU ever showed a predictable difference between before and after. Just as Farjalla et al predicted, the strength of environmental fitlering is in negative proportion to body size. Over the same time interval, insects and zooplankton developed more of a response to the environment than did bacteria. 

We found that dispersion, in all cases, was lower at the end of the experiment than at the beginning. This indicates that our treatments were effectingve in removing beta diverstiy among patches. that is, that all habitats really did end up being very similar at the beginning, as we would expect. However, the amount of this decline was the same across all organism groups (`r tab("disp_tab")`), as indicated by the 

The difference between insects and zooplankton was not as great as we expected it would be. that was probably because we were missing the active vs passive differences. Insect females choose where to place their eggs, evalutating resources and predation risk (citecitecite). On the other hand, the macroinvertebrate taxa that did respond are also the more abundant taxa; it may be that we only had the ability to detect patterns for these taxa. Both of these issues at once (should we do permanova on mortality?). Both size does predict some of the variation in response to the environment. Since active dispersers are also larger, there is then a relationship between that life history and body size -- larger animals are more likely to disperse actively. It may be that those groups show a response in that direction as well. 

In conclusion, here we have shown that a hypothesis made by variance partitioning and by observations, can be supported by a manipulative experiment and a different statistical approach. that, I guess, is probably good news for variance partitioning methods, which have come under a lot of criticism lately. iN our experiment we removed the variation in community composition between habitats, and were essentially able to watch the recovery of beta diversity in our system. Measured as both turnover and dispersion, in that test I haven't even done yet. 

In other words our experiment has not only confirmed some aspects of the body size habitat senstivity experiment, but also investigated the rate at which beta diversity is recovered for these different groups. p
