# Abstract

The species of all groups of organisms respond to their environment, but not all groups respond to the same degree. Observational studies have already suggested that
larger-bodied species are more strongly filtered by habitat than smaller- bodied
species. However, this mechanism has never been tested experimentally. In our
study we placed highly similar aquatic communities (composed of insects,
zooplankton and bacteria) into different environments and observed subsequent
divergence in composition. We predicted that insects would show a strong change
in composition, zooplankton a moderate change and bacteria little to no change.
Our results are consistent with these predictions, with the exception of a
weaker signal in insects than expected. These results suggest that organism size
could provide a framework for integrating studies of environmental filtering
across different scales and systems.

# Introduction

Community composition of local patches varies in response to the environment;
however not all species within a community respond in the same degree.
"Habitat filtering" occurs when qualities of the habitat (abiotic or biotic)
prevent species from colonizing or persisting. In contrast,
neutral models of biodiversity consider all individuals in a community to be
demographically equivalent; differences in species composition are therefore
the result of dispersal and demographic stochasticity. This has led to the
approach of partitioning variance in community composition into variation
correlated with space, with environmental distance, or with their interaction.
These studies have returned mixed results for different groups of organisms
and systems (Cottenie). One reason for these mixed results is the very different qualities of habitats compared or groups of organisms compared. In one of the first studies across different groups of
organisms in the same community, Farjalla et al (2012) demonstrated that body
size is a key trait determining environmental signal in community composition.
They found that groups of organisms which are physically larger show a greater degree of
habitat filtering: there is weaker environmental structure as body size
decreases from insects (strong signal), zooplankton (moderate signal) and bacteria
(weak signal).

Why should the strength of environmental filtering decrease with organism
size? There are two possible mechanisms that may make communities of smaller
organisms less strongly filtered: 

increased dispersal rates and increased
plasticity. Dispersal rates increase when smaller organisms are easily
passively carried (e.g. by wind). Increased dispersal brings new immigrants
into a community, many of whom may not be able to persist without the constant
supply of new immigrants. These "source-sink" dynamics (Leibold) can lead to
similarity between patches even when their environments favour different
community compositions. Increased plasticity, on the other hand, occurs when
smaller-bodied species have broader fundamental niches than larger-bodied
species in the same community. This is the "size-plasticity" hypothesis of
Farjalla et al (2012). Bacteria and other small organisms are broadly
generalist in their ability to consume carbon sources and persist in different
climates (Finlay 2002) and are less constrained by the complex physiological
pathways possessed by larger metazoans. Additionally, smaller-bodied organisms
have shorter generation times and generally larger populations, which may
allow them the opportunity to evolve to a novel environment more rapidly than
larger-bodied organisms.

The size-plasticity hypothesis makes a testable prediction about the
consequences of environmental variation for similar communities: communities which begin at a simiar species composition will diverge under different environments, but this divergence
will be greatest between larger species and increasingly weak in smaller
organisms. To test these predictions, we performed a manipulative experiment
in the same habitat as Farjalla et al. (2012). We studied the same groups of
organisms (insects, zooplankton and bacteria) in the same patchy, highly
variable habitat (three species of tank bromeliads). We created communities
that were as similar as possible in composition, then exposed these
communities to their original environmental conditions. We predicted community
change to be greater and more consistent in insects, less strong in
zooplankton and absent in bacteria. If instead differences in communities are
driven by spatial processes we will see no difference in the strength of
environmental signal across all groups. We made predictions for two sources of environmental variation:

* __Between-species__: Our site contains three bromeliad species with different habitat preferences. We took advantage of this variation to select bromeliads of different species from different habitats. This creates the maximum differences in habitat possible, and is similar to the variation observed by Farjalla et al (2012). In this experiment, "habitat variation" includes variation in the local environment (sun/shade, amount of detritus input) and variation in bromeliad species.`

* __Within-species__: One of the bromeliad species used in the between-species experiment is a broad habitat generalist. We conducted a second experiment with this species, testing how local environmental conditions (i.e. shady or exposed) influences community composition, while holding bromeliad species constant.

In both experiments we expect the amount of environmental signal in different groups to be less in smaller groups (that is, macroinvertebrates > zooplankton > bacteria).  We expect weaker results in the within-species experiment, since the bromeliad species itself is an important source of environmental variation for the organisms which live within.

# Methods

## Experimental design

We performed two related experiments: the first contrasted different bromeliad
species from different habitats ("between-species"), while the second
contrasted the same bromeliad species from different habitats ("within-
species"). We focused on three bromeliad species from three
contrasting habitats; these species and habitats are identical to those surveyed
by Farjalla et al. (2010). Each bromeliad species was collected from its typical
habitat: _Aechmea nudicaulis_ (full sun habitats), _Vriesea neoglutinosa_
(partial shade), and _Neoregelia cruenta_ (full shade). _Neoregelia_ has a uniquely large habitat range at this site, occuring in both full shade and full sun. This large habitat range enabled us to conduct a second, within-species experiment.  This second experiment compared _Neoregelia_ communities
between full sun and deep shade.

### Study site

We performed our experiments at the Parque Nacional de Jurubatiba, Northeast Rio
de Janeiro state, Brazil ($22^{\circ}$ S $41^{\circ}$). The landscape is
composed of large semi-open patches of shrubs which form shady patches
interspersed with very exposed, sunny habitats (_restinga_ vegetation).
Bromeliads (Bromeliaceae) form dense colonies within this landscape. The
landscape is composed of large semi-open clumps of shrubs interspersed with very
exposed, open sand. Several bromeliad taxa here collect standing water
(phytotelmata) in deep leaf axils, and are known to contain diverse communities 
of macroinvertebrates, zooplankton and bacteria.

## Experimental design

Both between- and within-species experiments used similar designs: five blocks
of six bromeliads each. To create each block in the between-species experiment,
we collected two bromeliads of each of the three species; in the within-species experiment we
collected three bromeliads from open habitats and three from closed habitats.  In both
experiments, all bromeliads in a block were stocked with a nearly identical
starting community, intermediate between that of all six bromeliads in that
block. We made these starting communities by sampling, then combining, each of
three major groups: macroinvertebrates, zooplankton and bacteria.  

We sampled macroinvertebrates by thoroughly rinsing each bromeliad and passing
the water through 1mm and 180μm mesh to collect aquatic macroinvertebrates.  We
identified these animals to morphospecies, then divided them equally among the
six bromeliads in the block.  

We sampled the starting zooplankton and bacteria communities by mixing an equal
volume of filtered tank water from each plant (approximately 100ml plant^-1^),
returning the same volumes to all bromeliads.  

We emptied bromeliads by hanging them upside down to dry for at least 24 hours
and then rinsing each plant with 70% ethanol. Any coarse detritus found in the
bromeliads was similarly cleaned, frozen and thawed (to kill any macroinvertebrates eggs). We
confirmed that this technique removed all invertebrates and most detritus by
dissecting an empty bromeliad. Bromeliads were placed in a local habitat similar
to their original, each enclosed in a 2mm mesh cage to prevent colonization by
insects. We then added the starting communities of macroinvertebrates,
zooplankton and bacteria.

The experiment lasted for 12 days, after which we collected all
macroinvertebrates, and a sample of zooplankton and bacteria.
Macroinvertebrates were identified while live and preserved in ethanol.
Zooplankton were collected on 50-micron Nytex mesh and fixed in 5% buffered
formalin. Subsamples were then identified to the lowest
taxonomic unit possible (species in most cases, except for bdelloid rotifers
and harpaticoid copepods, left at the level of class and order, respectively).
We measured bacterial community composition using denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis (DGGE; Muyzer et al. 1993). This analysis furnishes an
approximation of bacterial diversity in the form of Operational Taxonomic
Units (OTUs). We based these collection methods as closely as possible upon
previous observational work, to facilitate a direct comparison (Farjalla et al. 2010).

### Analyses

For each of our two experiments, we performed a pair of statistical tests: a
permutation test (PERMANOVA) to detect differences in the degree of
environmental signal among groups, and a multivariate regression of abundance
to identify those taxa which contributed most to the differences. PERMANOVA
measures the amount of difference in community composition between treatment
groups and compares this to the expected distribution under a null hypothesis of no treatment effects.
If larger-bodied groups of organisms are more filtered, then we expect to find
a greater difference in community composition emerge among the
macroinvertebrates, less among the zooplankton, and little to none among
bacteria.
